# Links

Here I am including links to some of my writing, interviews, videos, as well as IT certs and other blogs, Youtube channels, and other content I find interesting. I miss the days when people would include links to other peoples content. Hoping to bring back some of that community spirit from the internet of yesteryear. I must state that links to other people's content does not act as a wholesale endorsement, and that their views or actions may or may not coincide with that of my own. I plan to update this page regularly to add, subtract, and reorganize according to my nonsensical whims.

### Youtube Channels  
#### Linux  
- [Jake@Linux](https://www.youtube.com/@JakeLinux) - Great content for anyone looking for something other than Ubuntu, or anything outside the norm, while perfecting the core workflow of your machine.  
- [Chris Titus Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech) - Chris was my guide to using Linux full-time. Very beginner friendly and not fanatical like me or most of those I watch.   
- [Kris Occhipinti](https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalMetal) - Kris gets into the nitty gritty of a lot of the behind the scenes processes on Linux. A wealth of pertinent knowledge.  
#### Tech  
- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) - It's funny because I don't know the first thing about development, and Fireship is almost solely about development and coding languages. But the content is great, and I learn something with every video.  
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile) - If you ever felt the need for people to talk about computers on a level that seems esoteric and makes you feel irredeemably stupid, look no further. Computers as philosophy and religion. One of my favorites.  
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) - I started using freeCodeCamp in the beginning of my journey into IT, and I stand behind their platform and their vision 100%. I can't gush enough about these guys and their content.  
- [NetworkChuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) - I was initially turned off by this guy's Leave-It-To-Beaver kind of cheerleader approach, and a lot of his stuff seems really click-baity, but he is still a great resource that really shouldn't be ignored.  
#### Cybersecurity  
- [SimplyCyber](https://www.youtube.com/@SimplyCyber) - I mostly catch Gerald's Daily Cyber Threat Brief, but he offers a conglomerate of worth while content, especially those looking to get into cybersecurity.   
- [John Hammond](https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010) - The man, the myth, the legend. Seriously, probably the most well known cybersecurity content creator and for good reason.  
- [David Bombal](https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidBombal) - It seems unfair to pigeonhole David as strictly infosec, because he is actually a network guy professionally, but most his content as of late seems to gravitate towards that, and it is why I watch him.  
- [Day Cyberwox](https://www.youtube.com/c/DayCyberwox) - Day has become quite the tour de force in the cybersecurity content creator realm. His blueprint for a homelab is shared all over the place, and he has documented every step in his journey.  
#### Fun   
- [Beau of the Fifth Column](https://www.youtube.com/@BeauoftheFifthColumn) - Travis' videos are normally political and social commentary by nature, but he seems more than that. He's like the uncle you never knew that you really wanted/needed.   
- [Daily Dose of Internet](https://www.youtube.com/@DailyDoseOfInternet) - I am not sure if I know anybody not familiar with this guy, but his content is a great reprieve from the rest of the internet.  
- [Tamara's Blue Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/@TamarasBlueChicken) - I fell in love with Tamara's ring neck parrot Kiwi, as I am sure everybody else will to.   
- [K'eyush the Stunt Dog](https://www.youtube.com/@KeyushTheStuntDog) - I discovered K'eyush (known affectionately as Key) when I was working overnights at a homeless shelter. Key's videos brought me much joy, and much needed relief from the constant suffering I was privy to.  
- [Matteo Lane](https://www.youtube.com/@matteolanecomedy) - He is just so adorable and so funny. I just can't get enough of him. 
- [Sheena Melwani](https://www.youtube.com/c/SheenaMelwani) - I fell in love with watching Sheena's husband(?) Trid mess with her and his dad jokes. Super funny.
