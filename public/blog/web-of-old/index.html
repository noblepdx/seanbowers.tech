<p>According to modern standards, this would be considered bad design. But these graphics had imagination. Individuality. People made websites and graphics from scratch before we understood the technology. Now that we have the technology, our sites are bland, white washed, cookie cutter cutouts of every other boring site. This website, while minimal, is in remembrance of the internet of yore. No more symmetrical, design theory, brand recognition.</p>
