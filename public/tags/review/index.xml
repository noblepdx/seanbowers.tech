      <description>Throughout my life, there have been a great number books and albums that have come at just the right time, that the only way to properly describe them is to say they &amp;ldquo;saved my life.&amp;rdquo; More often than not this is merely hyperbole. But in the case of the album Borders &amp;amp; Boundaries by Less Than Jake, it definitely carried me through the end of my drinking.
This is even more ironic as I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily like Less Than Jake.</description>
