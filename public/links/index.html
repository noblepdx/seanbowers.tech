<p>Here I am including links to some of my writing, interviews, videos, as well as IT certs and other blogs, Youtube channels, and other content I find interesting. I miss the days when people would include links to other peoples content. Hoping to bring back some of that community spirit from the internet of yesteryear. I must state that links to other people&rsquo;s content does not act as a wholesale endorsement, and that their views or actions may or may not coincide with that of my own. I plan to update this page regularly to add, subtract, and reorganize according to my nonsensical whims.</p>

<h3 id="youtube-channels">Youtube Channels</h3>
<h4 id="linux-1">Linux</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JakeLinux">Jake@Linux</a> - Great content for anyone looking for something other than Ubuntu, or anything outside the norm, while perfecting the core workflow of your machine.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech">Chris Titus Tech</a> - Chris was my guide to using Linux full-time. Very beginner friendly and not fanatical like me or most of those I watch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalMetal">Kris Occhipinti</a> - Kris gets into the nitty gritty of a lot of the behind the scenes processes on Linux. A wealth of pertinent knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tech">Tech</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship">Fireship</a> - It&rsquo;s funny because I don&rsquo;t know the first thing about development, and Fireship is almost solely about development and coding languages. But the content is great, and I learn something with every video.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile">Computerphile</a> - If you ever felt the need for people to talk about computers on a level that seems esoteric and makes you feel irredeemably stupid, look no further. Computers as philosophy and religion. One of my favorites.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp">freeCodeCamp</a> - I started using freeCodeCamp in the beginning of my journey into IT, and I stand behind their platform and their vision 100%. I can&rsquo;t gush enough about these guys and their content.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck">NetworkChuck</a> - I was initially turned off by this guy&rsquo;s Leave-It-To-Beaver kind of cheerleader approach, and a lot of his stuff seems really click-baity, but he is still a great resource that really shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cybersecurity-1">Cybersecurity</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SimplyCyber">SimplyCyber</a> - I mostly catch Gerald&rsquo;s Daily Cyber Threat Brief, but he offers a conglomerate of worth while content, especially those looking to get into cybersecurity.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnHammond010">John Hammond</a> - The man, the myth, the legend. Seriously, probably the most well known cybersecurity content creator and for good reason.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidBombal">David Bombal</a> - It seems unfair to pigeonhole David as strictly infosec, because he is actually a network guy professionally, but most his content as of late seems to gravitate towards that, and it is why I watch him.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DayCyberwox">Day Cyberwox</a> - Day has become quite the tour de force in the cybersecurity content creator realm. His blueprint for a homelab is shared all over the place, and he has documented every step in his journey.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fun">Fun</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BeauoftheFifthColumn">Beau of the Fifth Column</a> - Travis&rsquo; videos are normally political and social commentary by nature, but he seems more than that. He&rsquo;s like the uncle you never knew that you really wanted/needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DailyDoseOfInternet">Daily Dose of Internet</a> - I am not sure if I know anybody not familiar with this guy, but his content is a great reprieve from the rest of the internet.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TamarasBlueChicken">Tamara&rsquo;s Blue Chicken</a> - I fell in love with Tamara&rsquo;s ring neck parrot Kiwi, as I am sure everybody else will to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KeyushTheStuntDog">K&rsquo;eyush the Stunt Dog</a> - I discovered K&rsquo;eyush (known affectionately as Key) when I was working overnights at a homeless shelter. Key&rsquo;s videos brought me much joy, and much needed relief from the constant suffering I was privy to.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@matteolanecomedy">Matteo Lane</a> - He is just so adorable and so funny. I just can&rsquo;t get enough of him.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SheenaMelwani">Sheena Melwani</a> - I fell in love with watching Sheena&rsquo;s husband(?) Trid mess with her and his dad jokes. Super funny.</li>
